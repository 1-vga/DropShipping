The SOL Republic Punk bluetooth speaker meets this challenge head on. It is compact enough to fit in a cargo pocket, and rugged enough to take a beating while camping to the camp site. made with what feels to be a hard rubberized shell, the speaker is resistant to water and dust. All of this without sacrificing style too. It actually looks as cool as it sounds. Not like some big, boxy, overprotected speaker that you would find used in the military.<br /><br />As far as sound quality, i have heard better. Actually, I have heard much better as the SOL Republic doesn't try to compete with the Bose of the world. But for the functionality and dependability I get from it, it is worth the money and above average sound quality.<br /><br />If you are an outdoors person and like me have blown through multiple other bluetooth speakers that can't handle the elements, the SOL Republic may be a great addition to your bag.",

However upon closer review, the single function &#34;Bluetooth/Power&#34; switch is inelegant and is at times unreliable as a power off / on switch. Also, if you look at  pictures and videos posted on-line, the headphone/power connector is off center and not &#34;seated&#34;  in the plastic housing. I am sure this is most likely ok in term of functionality; aesthetically it makes the headphones look unfinished and cheap. The charging cable has a 2.5 mm jack, why not use a mini USB like most other headphones? I will probably keep these as my primary commuter cans. They fold nicely and sound just a tad bit more rich than my Jabra Move headphones. The JBL's also isolate sound better than my toughly built Jabra Move head phones. However, the build quality of the Swedish designed Jabra's are just better than the JBL's. C'mon JBL, give the E40BT replacement a separate power slide on/off switch and stand alone LED status light. Also, seat the jack connector properly. If you did all of that I would most likely have scored a solid 5 star.",

It takes a bit of effort to move this but the up side is that once in place, it doesn't move.  We like that it moves away and towards the wall it's mounted on.  This makes it easy to get behind it for cables and cleaning.  Being able to swivel it for the occasional people siting to the side of the room has been a benefit we use more often than we thought we would.  I was also happy that it allows the TV to \\\\\"slide\\\\\" left to right which aids centering on the wall or moving toward us if to one side of the room.  Adjustment was very easy for making the TV level - 1 tension screw - just loosen it, level it and tighten the screw.    I took the advice in the other reviews here and bought better Lag Bolts.  I bought higher quality Stainless Steel Lags.  I've had low quality Lags with other products that would snap off as I would rachet them into 2x4 studs.  These appeared to be of lessor quality Lags so I just didn't want to risk it.    There is some very minor flexing of the mount but nothing more than expected.  You got plenty of adjustment range anyway.    I gave this 5 star in spite of my suspicion of the Lag Bolts - I didn't test them so I really don't know if they were a problem.      The directions were ok - if you need them.  There really isn't much to this.  Just relax and look at it logically and you'll see how easy it is to put together.    I would purchase this item again in a heartbeat.",

Our TV is from 2004, the dvd player is from 2008, the stereo is from 1994, and the antenna converter box is from 2011 and all the remotes work with it. Their website is very easy to use and syncing the remote is a breeze. I highly recommend this remote.",

I have several of these from this company in a variety of lengths and they are all very good.<br /><br />Note: LMR-400 jumpers, even the Ultra Flex, are going to be overkill for most ham radio operators and others. It is a very heavy duty coax designed to be very low loss over a wide range of frequencies and power ranges, and as such, it thick and very stiff. Don't get me wrong, it will work exceptionally well, but caution is needed when using it because even the Ultra Flex is extremely stiff. If you aren't careful, the cable can act as a lever, multiplying the force you apply to bend it, and transferring that force to the connectors on the cable and your equipment and possibly damaging it. When using cable this stiff, position your equipment FIRST. Then position the cable, bending the cable to the proper position BEFORE you hook it to your equipment. Never move your equipment with the cable connected to it. This can generate enough torque to damage the connectors. Disconnect the cable first, move the equipment, re-bend the LMR-400 to the proper shape and position to connect to the device, and only then actually connect it.<br /><br />Yes, you can make your own more cheaply. But I hate soldering on PL-259 connectors and don't like to do it unless I have to. If you want to do your own, great. I admire you. If you hate doing it, haven't had the practice or experience to feel comfortable making your own, then you can't go wrong with these.",

            "hover_review_headline": "Nice Player, But It Has Drawbacks.... (Edit: Resolved)",
            "hover_review_body": "Having had about two months to play with this device, I have to say I concur with all the positives noted in most of the other reviews.  The music quality, screen size, photo clarity, etc. all appeal to me.  So I won't make a long list rehashing what you've probably already read.  But as nice as it is, the device does have some drawbacks.<br /><br />First and foremost to me is the GPS, based on Google Maps.  Since many might buy this item based partly on the presence of GPS technology, I think it would be helpful to know that you need internet access for the GPS to operate properly.  You need to be in range of a wi-fi transmitter in order to get directions.  It'll show you the map just fine, so it CAN actually detect where you are.  But without the internet connection, it can't give you directions.  So, if you're, let's say, in your car, where you're most likely to NEED GPS directions, you're not gonna get them.<br /><br />Now, I read in another customer review that Google Maps lets you cache (save) your maps with directions, which works fine for routes you've PLANNED to travel, or routes you travel regularly.  But what about the ones you didn't actually plan on?  The spur-of-the-moment, on-the-fly, change-of-plans directions you might need?  Reroutes due to traffic or construction?  This device won't give you that.  Not unless you find a McDonald's or Panera, or some other establishment that has free wi-fi.  I'll be keeping my [[ASIN:B001ELJ9QK Garmin n&uuml;vi 265W/265WT 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with Traffic]], unless Google - or Samsung - come up with a way to get on-the-fly directions.<br /><br />The second issue I have - relatively minor in the grand scheme - is the inability to change information relating to your songs ON the device.  I use Windows Media Player on my PC, and can change song info to whatever I like.  Previous MP3 players I've owned have accepted this, and displayed the information as I put it in.  This one makes decisions for me.  Consequently, I have a huge folk music collection on my Samsung, that does not exist on my PC.  My 80's and 90's sections are gone, absorbed under other genre.  So, if I wanted to listen to a certain type of music, I may be screwed, because it's not set up like it was in WMP.  The music display is also iffy, wherein if a song doesn't have a particular piece of album art associated with it, the player will randomly assign it a picture from any other song that DOES have art assigned.  Listening to Luther Vandross?  You may see an album cover for Hollywood Undead.  And you can't change it.  Except to change the display to one of the lame music visualizations  included.  Longing for the \\\\\"Bars and Waves\\\\\" visualization of Windows Media Player.<br /><br />Lastly, I've had an issue where, for no apparent reason, after turning on the device with memory card installed, I was notified that the card was damaged.  This has happened twice so far.  Nothing untoward happened to the device.  It was not dropped, or immersed in water, or stepped on by an elephant, or used as a chew toy for a pit bull.  It was just sitting.  Off.  When turned on...\\\\\"Card Damaged\\\\\".  No longer detects anything that was there.  Like...your whole music library.  Videos.  Photos.  Card will require reformatting, and works fine after that...until the next time.  I'm not 100% sure where the fault is, with the player or with the card, but I would think a SanDisk card in a Samsung player should work just fine.  And these cards are a bit costly for trial-and-error.  Now, I haven't noticed this issue mentioned in any other reviews, so it may just be mine.  Of course, a larger internal memory capacity would obviate the need for a memory card in the first place, but I guess we're not gonna get that.<br /><br />In closing, I'll remind that I did give this player four stars.  It is a good MP3 player/mini tablet.  I do enjoy this product.  I am glad I bought it.  It is worth the money.  These are just the issues I've had with it.  If anyone out there knows a resolution (other than \\\\\"try a new memory card, dummy!), feel free to comment.<br /><br />***Edit - 2/25/12:  OK, with the help of some people who responded to my initial review (thank you all), I've solved the issue with unsatisfactory app performance.  Unfortunately, these two apps are not available on Amazon.  You'll have to get them from the Android Marketplace, which this device has access to.  They're not free, either one, but they appear to be worth it...so far.  So here goes....<br /><br />In addressing the GPS problem, I downloaded and installed CoPilot Live USA.  It costs $10 at the Marketplace.  No wi-fi connection is needed to operate this app on-the-fly.  You get to choose which maps you want to download: entire North America, U.S. only, or region of the country.  The larger the area, the larger the download, the longer it takes.  And U.S. takes a LONG time (talking HOURS here, not minutes).  Don't worry, it WILL let you know when the download is complete.  Just be patient.  In testing the app to a destination I know well, it kept trying to route me to a specific roadway, even though that's not the best route.  But when I deviated from its instructions, rerouting was very quick.  Its text-to-speech seems to be a bit lacking, which can be disconcerting at first.  It speaks \\\\\"US 1\\\\\" as \\\\\"us 1\\\\\" instead of \\\\\"U.S. 1\\\\\".  \\\\\"9A North\\\\\" became \\\\\"9 uhNorth\\\\\".  But looking at the screen shows the correct directions, so I guess I can deal with it.  Graphics are acceptable for a $10 GPS, and it claims to be able to locate points of interest.  I haven't tried out every aspect of this app yet, and I'm sure I'll get to tweaking the specifics sometime soon.  But so far it's much better than what's included with the Player.<br /><br />As for the music player, I downloaded and installed Poweramp.  The trial version is free in the Marketplace, and you have to download that first.  You get a two-week trial (if it takes you that long to decide), and then you can buy the unlock code if you want to keep the app.  Four bucks, I think.  Something like that.  The app lets you edit all pertinent information for a song ON THE PLAYER, no computer necessary.  It also can be set to download album art from the internet when it's in range of a signal.  It only seems to download the playing song and a few after it, though, and not the whole library at once, so it can take a while to get everything covered.  It also, for some songs, will come up with the wrong picture, as some titles or artists are not specific enough to get a solid hit, and Poweramp admits its search parameters are \\\\\"fuzzy\\\\\".  But the overall majority of pictures do connect with either the specific song or artist in general that you're looking for.  And if you choose not to go with album art, the Poweramp logo looks pretty cool on its own.<br /><br />So I'm happier now.  I still can't move it up to a 5-star rating, 'cuz that would imply that there's no room for improvement.  As I said in my initial review, a larger internal capacity would be nice.  But it's good to work out some of the kinks.sues I've had with it.

To add to the features it has an LED flashlight, a reading light, and cell phone charging capability. The radio will automatically scan the frequency bands for stations too! It works well and I highly recommend it for your emergency backup radio,",

Only complaint is the pushbutton switch on the center knob used to turn the alarm off, which requires a little too much force to operate. Overall the best clock radio I've owned.",
