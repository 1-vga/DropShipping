These have done a great job not only on my dishwasher, air conditioner, and local traffic, but even reduced other sounds, such as talking, at an unexpected rate.<br />No, these won't make things silent. Their purpose is to reduce noise, which they do, even when not plugged in to anything. They have a slight white-noise hiss when activated, which personally is relaxing, but I can see where others might find it annoying, particularly when listening to music.<br />If you're an audiophile, pass on these. If you'd just like to reduce ambient sounds, these might be good for you.",

I could not find another HT receiver with this.  My old speakers are very fussy and I really need a graphic EQ to adjust the sound to my liking.  It was also rather reasonbly priced. In daily use, and occacionsal abuse, this receiver sounds good to my ears, and i like it's looks. kind of a throw back to the 70s in some respects. It has plenty of inputs, and should serve you well.   Some of the complaints are valid, the remote looks like a throwback to the 80s .... and is a little flakey, but once you get used to the quirks it is not a big deal.  You can't change from digital to analog with the remote, and you can not turn tape monitor on and off with the remote.  People also complain about the surround speaker connectors, as they are guillotine connectors instead of 5 ways... personally I like the guillotine connectors better.  The manual could be better, but for $200 ... this is a great receiver. these are no longer made, but if you are looking to get one on ebay or something I hope you find my input usefull.",

        "hover_review_body": "I bought this antenna to replace an old rabbit ears setup in my camper. The rabbit ears worked great but took up too much space and looked old & junky. After researching several different models, I felt that either the Leaf or Amplified Leaf were the way to go, especially for my camper application.  I chose the Amplified Leaf because I figured an amplified signal would work better than a non-amplified one and also because I caught a great Amazon warehouse deal. In retrospect, I probably would have just went with the regular, non-amplified model. This is not to detract from the amplified Leaf in any way, it works awesome. It's just that I'm not sure it was worth the few extra bucks for use in my camper. Read some of the other reviews up here. Buying either the amplified or non-amplified version depends a lot on your location & application.<br /><br />The amplifier itself has to be plugged in to AC power, or can be plugged into a TV USB slot. This is a convenient feature for my camper because both AC plugs in the area where the TV is located are already being used. Plugging the amplifier directly into the TV's USB slot also allows me to save precious DC power when not using hook-ups. The amp only turns on when the TV turns on, perfect!<br /><br />In short, despite paying extra for the amplified leaf, I am extremely satisfied with the purchase. It works great, is easy to conceal, and takes up no space. I would definitely buy another If needed and highly recommend it to others.",

If your HD-DVD player or Blu-Ray player does the decoding of DTS-HD Master Audio or Dolby True-HD then the receiver will receive the signal as uncompressed PCM.  The only reason this receiver has HDMI 1.3 is so that when High Definition players can send out the signal via bitstream the receiver will do the decoding and it will say Dolby True-HD or DTS-HD Master Audio.<br /><br />HDMI 1.3 is still in its infancy.  There are some problems.  First off, if you have an HD-A1 don't get this receiver.  The HDMI connection won't work because of incompatibility.<br /><br />Now to the biggest problem with this receiver.  There are countless AVS threads online that speak of HDMI problems with this receiver.  I'm here to tell you they're true.  Listening to any Uncompressed PCM track on a Blu-Ray movie produces an annoying humming noise, and many have even heard  popping noises from their speakers.<br /><br />Cnet may review this high, but listen to the customers who've actually used this receiver for more than a day.<br /><br />I used to have an Onkyo receiver and though that they were the best bang for your buck.

It freezes once in a while, but I keep a needle stuck inside the case to hit the reset button with; very convenient!    I Love my Zen and would not even consider buying an overpriced, overly advertised iPod, as long as Creative makes such awesome MP3 players.  Unfortunately, Creative is designing some of their new MP3 players after the iPod.  I hope Creative keep making players in their own design also, for the customers who love it.    I can't believe I spent about $100 for this player and can sell it for about $100, 4 1/2 years later!  :)  But I wouldn't.",

        "hover_review_body": "I purchased this TV mount for a 55\\\\\" 45 pound (without the stand) Samsung LED TV. Though this tilt wall mount appears to be well constructed, once you take the time to install and use the mount, flaws are apparent.<br /><br />There are 4 plastic bushings that control the tilting ability of the TV. My tilt came from Amazon loose at these 4 bushings. Once I had the TV on the wall it immediately tilted all the way down. Adjusting the TV, it immediately would dangerously swing back down. After taking the TV off the wall to investigate I found that these bushings were not tight. Further investigation it appears the wrong size plastic bushings are used paired with the bolts and lock-nuts that they pivot on. Because of this, there is excessive play in the adjustment of the TV stand's tiling. Essentially the 10 degrees of upward tilt is not possible because of this flaw. Also as a result, the TV will wobble when the wall/house shakes.<br /><br />Because of this loose issue with the tilt mechanism, I reversed the left and right attachments to the back of the TV so I can easily get to these lock nuts with a socket extension to tighten them without taking the TV off the wall.<br /><br />The advertised tilt angle is incorrect because of the tilt play/wobble, the TV will not hold itself at 10 degrees up. You can push and hold the TV at 10 degrees, but when it relaxes, you will be closer to 2-4 degrees max. The forward tilt is therefore better than 15 degrees, closer to 20 degrees.<br /><br />I am sure that if the cylinder shaped bushings provided a snug fit this TV mount would function as advertised.<br /><br />I stop just shy of saying this TV mount is unsafe. It does hold the TV and even when the bushings that hold the tilt angle fail I cannot foresee the TV falling from the wall.<br /><br />Installing a wall mount is a real pain, you have to find studs in your walls, drill the mounting holes, etc... I do not want to go through that again with a different TV mount. My recommendation is spend money on a wall mount that has good reviews and/or that you've physically seen and confirmed that it is well constructed and pivots as needed. Don't cheap out and get this unit.",

They have excellent treble, but the bass lacks a bit only due to the fact that they sit far away from eardrums. The sound becomes really enjoyable when a slight pressure is placed upon them, only then they deliver the right amount of bass. Had the Sennheiser designed the earphone part slightly longer, the delivery of the sound would have been perfect as they contain enough treble as well as bass.

I felt I should share what I learned because after my initial experience I thought they were terrible but eventually I got them to sound incredible. So here goes....    The ergonomics of this product are awful at first. It takes a long time to properly fit the earpiece to your ear so that you can put the earbuds in properly. For a product with this price point this part should be much more robust. Personally, I dislike having the cabling go behind my ears but there is absolutely no practical way to use them any other way. OK, it is different than what I am used to but I am getting used to that quickly. It just seems to take way too long to put the earbuds on because of the construction of the earpiece. The cable seems to slip out of them a lot. Eventually I got it working and comfortable and once you do they are solid in your ear even if you work out. The cable connection to the rca jack is a bit flimsy and you can hear static if you move it around more than just a little.    The bigger problem is fitting the earbuds properly for sound quality. The default foam and rubber inserts just did NOT work at all for me and the quality of the bass was just atrocious. I knew based on some previous reviews that bass was good for many people so I did not want to give up. I tried EVERY one of the inserts to no avail. I finally went out and bought a set of Comply T400 inserts for these headphones. You can buy them on Amazon or at your local Radio Shack. Wow is all I can say!!! The difference was beyond incredible. It transformed a horrible initial experience into a sublime listening device. Clarity was crystal clear with just fantastic frequency response across the whole audio spectrum and a great sound field. I used the song \\\\\"Back to the Hotel\\\\\" by N2Deep for my bass comparison because it is prominent but hard to get right for inferior equipment. It was completely different with and without the inserts. Without the inserts you would not be able to make out the notes. With them you could sit down and play it out directly. This song is also helpful because it has recurring high treble parts that would just get lost on bad earbuds. I also put in Bill Evans' \\\\\"Peace Piece\\\\\" to see how they sounded on pure piano played over a wide octave and dynamic range. Just wonderful so if you like classical or jazz they have the frequency response you need.    These headphones are flawed in the ergonomics but the sound quality is so good if you add the T400's that it is worth putting up with. Like a restaurant with a snotty Maitre' D but incredible food. You put up with it cause it just is so tasty! Sound gets 5 stars but I only gave the product 4 because of the poor earpiece ergonomics and the fact that I had to go and spend extra time and money to make the product perform properly.",

I have a room that is about 20 x 20, and the speakers do a great job. The sub is also pretty crisp and clear. I can turn the volume up as loud as I want without any distortion at all.

The only negative I can say is that eventually I will upgrade the Subwoofer...it could be  a little crisper, but it is definately very adequate. It is probably 5 times better than the sub that came with my Sony system. I just really like crisp, clean bass that I can really feel.

I even use them for some djing since they are so much more light/comfortable than \\\\\"real\\\\\" $150 sony dj headphones, and I got em for about $50.   <br /> <br />Another plus: the headphone cable is replaceable, which I can't say for $150 sony dj headphones.  After about 4-5 years of heavy use and accidentally stepping on the cable I finally broke the cable on my HD-212's, but was able to order a replacement cable from Sennheiser.  When the plug on my sony dj headphones broke, the headphones became useless.",

Such a small unit with such great sound appears to be a magic trick...but the thing is real!  I will never have to take any other speaker system along when I stay in a hotel room or when doing a presentation where I need to play an audio clip.  In addition, the speaker phone feature works very well without distortion.    Some reviewers have commented on the somewhat odd use of the buttons (to adjust volume, etc.).  After a few minutes, I had it all figured out.  The integrated buttons keep the unit very sleek, so I had no issues with a little learning curve.    I would highly recommend this product to anyone!",

        "hover_review_body": "I have had these portable speakers for about 6 months now.  I use them with my computer and with an iRiver H320 player when I am traveling.<br /><br />First the PROS:  Compact, cool looking speakers which come with their own little carry bag and fit into lots of small spaces. Plastic connectors allow both speakers to fit together as a single unit when stored, great for travelling and speaker protection.  A USB cord allows you to bypass the batteries required to run the amp... highly convenient when you have your computer.  Nice little pop out stands which stem from the same connectors which keep the speakers together during transport. Suitable amplification circuit (read the cons below!), can produce sufficient volume for indoor listening.  Battery life from 4 AAA's is acceptable, I usually would run about 8 hours at a time and then turn them off.  They would run 2 sessions (16 hours total) under these conditions so that seems pretty good.  Great price and it comes with all the connectors.<br /><br />Now the CONS:  Despite the cool looks these are NOT electrostatic.  It is a little speaker set up under what is no doubt a highly engineered acoustic radiator material and box... just don't let the sun shine thru it.. you will see how simple it appears.  This type of system produces the biggest CON.  Sound quality is acceptable until you have some bass at moderate volumes.  Almost any bass at all, causes that acoustic radiator panel to RATTLE. You can definitely hear it.  This is why this is an indoor speaker.  At indoor personal listening volumes everything is fine.  Want to crank it?  This is not the speaker for you.  Another con is the battery insertion procedure which requires you to learn that you do not just insert batteries but rather have to form a \\\\\"tent\\\\\" with all the batteries positioned just right and then push down the cover.  Silly and took some time to learn. The plastic casing does feel flimsy and the speaker connectors/stands might feel like they could break at any time.  (Mine have not, I am careful).  The plug in for the AC (or USB cable) does not plug in all the way or in a truly positive fashion.<br /><br />Alright so there are a lot of cons.  Don't let that deter you.  For the price this is a cool little speaker, which despite my observations I have enjoyed over many months.  It is light and compact, surviving travel.<br /><br />For the makers of this speaker here are the suggestions.  Make an upgraded model at higher cost... put some real electrostatics in the upgrade!  Use higher quality materials (metal?). I assure you the market will bear it.  I just bought a Virgin Electronics boomtube for a marked down $50 (retail was $100...heavier with metal construction and more expensive, but REALLY cool--good luck finding the EX model with the subwoofer though--Virgin was selling these, and at $200 the EX, by all accounts is a a great speaker--I wish I could find one--but it is not for travelling with the weight).<br /><br />For this model, fix the battery case and insertion.  Make the AC connector a positive fit.  Change the color of the front panel to an opaque black or gray material.... really, do you want your customers to know that there is a little tiny cheap speaker inside these things when they set them up and light shines thru them?  Fix the bass rattle at higher volumes.<br /><br />Bottom line.  Try them.  Nice little speaker for the price! I think you will like them... just not if you listen to bass heavy music!ould break at any time.  (Mine have not, I am careful).
