It has excellent audio, is sturdily built, and is very sensitive to AM signals, making it a good radio for MW DXing. My only quibbles with it are that the dial scale is really off (about 200 KHz) and it picks up local noise more than my other radios. I have taken to marking the dial scale with a small black marker to indicate true tuning, and I  turn off the TV set when I use this radio. I don't have to do that with my other radios.<br /><br />But all things considered, this is a very good looking radio that is well worth the price.",

I'm even thinking of selling my other scanners and getting one more of these because it's so easy to use and setup. So, why am I only giving it a three out of five? Even though I bought it for a great price and I love this scanner, the retail on this thing is over $500. You can buy an iPhone and get yourself a scanner App and be able to do a lot more. You also have to pay another $99 to access the \\\\\"Extreme\\\\\" features of this unit. For $500 Uniden should have included these features with it. The fact that you have to pay extra is an insult. The unit does however come with the following:  - 4 x AA size Rechargeable NiMH Batteries (2300mAh)  - AC Adapter (AC 120V 60Hz 9V 800mA Regulated)  - DC Adapter (DC 12V to DC 9V 800mA Regulated)  - 2 GB micro SD for storing favorites lists and recording transmissions  - Antenna  - Desk Stand  - USB Cable  Fairly generous compared to what I received with my RadioShack Pro96 scanner. Again, for $500 I would have also included the following:  - GPS Cable  - Mobile mount  - Protective case  By biggest gripe is this unit seems cheaply made and if I dropped it I think that would be it. It should have been made more rugged for $500 otherwise it is a fantastic unit.",

At 900 mhz they don't interfere with the wireless router I have set up but they do pick up my phones some times because they are also 900 mhz.

Three times. Two out of the three times, it actually continued playing, the third time, it broke the bluetooth connection, but continued playing once it reconnected.<br /><br />The connections for the outlet and auxiliary ports are covered behind a plug that makes that area waterproof. It is recommended that you dry it off before opening that port, since water is a big deal when it comes to electronics. Also, if you don't get the plug closed correctly, water can come into that area. I would not hesitate to use it around pools and other water supply areas.<br /><br />It is virtually indestructible, and I don't have any issues with my granddaughter using it outside, in fact it makes a great addition to the videos she enjoys watching on the iPad. I listened to my music outdoors as well, and was very pleased with the sound.<br /><br />We have a very large yard, so the 33 ft doesn't extend to her fort, but I was able to test the connection, and it worked well around most of our yard.<br /><br />Things I really like:<br /><br />It comes with its own charger, and can charge through the included outlet OR off of the computer. Just one more choice I don't have to worry about.<br /><br />The hands free speakerphone that adds function to my iPhone.<br /><br />The fact that it really is shock resistant and waterproof.<br /><br />The long playtime without charging<br /><br />The handy size<br /><br />Things that were problematic for me:<br /><br />It took several tries to connect it to the bluetooth on my iPad. This was not my first experience with a bluetooth connection, so I was a bit surprised with the difficulty in the two finding each other.<br /><br />Once I got the speaker and iPad connected, things went well, but that first time I thought it wouldn't work at all. Bluetooth speakers aren't very handy if they don't connect to the source. I have given it four stars, because I eventually did get it to connect with my iPad, and I have several friends who have not had a similar problem.<br /><br />When I contacted Grace Digital, they stated that they had not experienced a problem like this in their testing process.aker and iPad connected, things went well, but that first time I thought it wouldn't work at all.

I have it on my kitchen TV.  The room has cathedral ceilings, windows & is about 25'x20' - more than enough power for this room.<br /><br />-One of the complaints with an earlier version of the Solo was that it did not have dialogue enhancement; this new version has it & it does improve the sound of dialogue.  It's a simple push of the button on the remote.<br />-Has Bluetooth so you can stream music from your device.  Pairs easily with my Samsung Galaxy S5 & S6.<br />-This sound bar comes with a universal remote so you can power on/off, change channels, volume & use a cable/satellite system on your TV or control devices.  It is a well designed remote - nice big buttons & easy to understand.  Full size: 9&#34; long x 2.25&#34; wide.

You should have at least 1&#34; more behind the unit for air circulation - so at least 15&#34; deep.<br />-Comes with the optical cable, 3.5mm audio cable & a power cord.<br />-The directions are good & easy to follow; this takes very little time to set up.<br /><br />I am using this with my kitchen TV (I have a complicated setup in my living room) - wow, it is perfect for that (maybe overkill).

        "hover_review_body": "I have a love-hate relationship with the Marantz SR5009.  I love the sound quality.  I've got a 3.1 setup.  I've got a pair of Golden Ear Triton 7s attached to the front channels, Golden Ear SuperSat 60 for the center, and a Golden Ear Forcefield 4 as the sub.  The vast majority of my music is either in MP3 or FLAC and sound great when streamed from my NAS (network attached storage).  When the subwoofer kicks in while watching a movie, I get startled by the life-like thuds and bangs.  It's awesome.  That's where my love of the SR5009 ends.<br /><br />I don't know where to begin with may hate list.<br />1) It can't connect to my wifi.  I don't know if it's my router (an old d-link), but every other gadget can connect to my wifi.  So I'm assuming there's something up with the Marantz.  It would connect to my neighbor's unsecured wifi, which is a NetGear router.  I had to get another router, set that router up in bridge mode, and connect the SR5009 to my new router.<br />2) Spotify doesn't recognize the SR5009 as a valid device.  My smartphone and the SR5009 are on the same network, and the spotify app doesn't show the SR5009.  I don't know.  Maybe there is an issue with Spotify, but I'm really skeptical of the networking abilities fo the SR5009.<br />3) Streaming from a NAS to the SR5009 is painful.  Every other device can quickly select and play music from my NAS without issue.  Only the SR5009 has problems.  I have yet to figure out a good solution to selecting music on my NAS to play on the SR5009.  The android app is terrible.  My current solution is to manually connect to the SR5009 from a browser on my computer or smartphone, by using the IP address of the SR5009.  I suspect that the SR5009 has a web server, which is what allows me to select different modes on the SR5009 and browse my NAS.<br />4) The Marantz app on Android is terrible.  It refuses to recognize the SR5009.  The third party app on Android is no better.<br />5) The surround sound decoding seems odd to me.  I don't know if the issue is with the SR5009 or my Directv receiver, but it seems like some sound channels are missing.  For example, when watching NFL games when the referee announces a penalty, the referee cannot be heard at all.  I played with every setting on both the SR5009 and directv receiver, but I couldn't figure out where the problem is.<br /><br />I could go on with the things I hate about this receiver.  I would not purchase this product again.  If your looking for a home theater receiver and  planning on using a lot of the network functionality, I would look elsewhere.  The SR5009 and it's network functionality is not good.  I can't believe they would release a product with so many quirks.",

After a few minutes of working \\\\\"correctly\\\\\", this thing began rotating to the turn-around point and back, continuously.  The only way to stop it is to turn the power off and back on.  Then it waits a while and starts all over.  I tried putting a black cloth over the whole control box, so it isn't stray infrared signals.<br /><br />2.  When it works \\\\\"correctly\\\\\", you have no way of knowing which way it will rotate when you push the button.  The electronic unit has only one button, and when pushed the unit may rotate left or right.  There's no way to predict, and there's no position indication to let you know which way it's pointing or rotating. The remote control has TWO buttons, so you would think one would be to rotate clockwise, and the other counterclockwise, but BOTH buttons get random directions, just like the single button on the electronics box.  CONCLUSION: even if you get a \\\\\"good\\\\\" one, this system is only usable if you can SEE which way it's pointing while adjusting its position.<br /><br />3.  It DOES get a stronger signal than the tiny amplified indoor antenna that came with my USB TV receiver, but still isn't really satisfactory, even for the three closest stations, none of which are major networks.<br /><br />4.  I would send this back, but it took so long to assemble that I don't want to bother disassembling it, and packing it up.  The power must be on for it to bring in a signal, so I plan to find a way to disable the rotator feature, and turn it by hand.<br /><br />4.  RECOMMENDATION: if you want a directional outdoor antenna, get a better one, and get a standard rotator, which will rotate it to the direction shown on the controller -- more expensive, but it does what's needed.  If you just want something to mount in an upstairs room where you can see it from your TV viewing location, then get a small directional antenna, and rotate it by hand.",

If a product does what it is suppose to do, why review it as something special. Saying that, there are a few products that are exceptional.  OK...down to business. I have a decent 5.1 audio system. Since my listening area (family room) is only 11' wide x 16' long with 8' ceilings, I can get by with bookshelf fronts & small surround speakers. All my speakers are Axiom Audio (M2s for the fronts, VP100 for the center and QS4 for the surrounds. I use a Mirage S8 sub. I have had this system for over 3 years. I started off with a Onkyo receiver and upgraded to a Marantz SR5006 about 2 years ago. The Marantz gave me a little wider and deeper sound stage over the Onkyo. It was also more detailed. To be honest, I was expecting more. By the way, even though the Emotiva is smaller than the Marantz, it weighs almost twice as much. It also runs a lot cooler.   I listen to most of my music from flac files on a thousand gig portable hard drive plugged (usb) into my Oppo blueray player. Quite a few of the files are high resolution (24 bit, 96htz & higher), some DVD 5.1 and some CD quality & vinyl.  After setting it up, I went to one of my \\\\\"test\\\\\" songs. It is a simple song with very little instramental from the Beatles (Here, There and Everywhere). The balance of the 5 speakers & sub were near perfect, the soundstage was wide & deep. The music was floating in the air, yet structured and the speakers seemed invisible....but....Lennon's lead voice was ...well...Lennon.  You could hear the texture and emotion in his voice. The backgound singing from McCartney & Harrison were also excellent. You could hear the indvidual and distinct voices harmonizing. The headroom was incredible. The sub was low, musical & tight. Everything from vocals to bass had a very clean and separated sound. The next three hours were a blur...listening from song to song was almost like hearing them for the first time. I paid $500 for this receiver (last time I looked it was down to $450). My Marantz was almost twice as much, however, IMO the Emotiva 8100 is twice the receiver. This is an exceptional product...especially for the cost.    PS~I also have my cable box running through the Emotiva and have no clicking sounds as described in some of the other reviews. However,  the first time with the cable, it did not have any audio & there was a message on the screen (from the Emotiva) stating just that. After making sure the connections were correct, I turned off everything, unplugged the cable box, plugged it back in and let it re-boot. Everything worked fine after that.",

Manufacturing quality is what I've come to expect from most moderately-priced things these days. Some holes aren't positioned as precisely as they should be, so a couple pieces don't line up quite right.<br /><br />The stands fall short on cable management. I think the designer expects everyone to use a very thin speaker wire without banana plugs or other convenience cable ends. The cable hole in the top plate is not much wider than a pencil. The hole in the bottom plate is better. The cable covers that run down the back are a pain. They are semi-rigid plastic strips that you bend to fit into slots. Installation is possible once you figure out a good method, but the design should be rethought. The designer was clearly trying to make the backs match the rounded fronts, which seems less important than simple installation.",
